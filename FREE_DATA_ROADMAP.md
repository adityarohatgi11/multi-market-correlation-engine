## 💡 Pro Tips for Free Data Success

### 1. Rate Limiting Strategy
```python
# Implement smart rate limiting:
- Yahoo Finance: 2000 req/min (very generous)
- FRED: 120 req/min (free tier)
- CoinGecko: 10-50 req/min
- Alpha Vantage: 25 req/day
- Stagger requests across sources
```

### 2. Data Caching Strategy
```python
# Cache frequently accessed data:
- Daily prices: Cache for 1 hour during market hours
- Economic indicators: Cache for 1 day
- Historical data: Cache indefinitely
- Real-time quotes: Cache for 1 minute
```

### 3. Fallback Strategy
```python
# Multi-source redundancy:
Primary: Yahoo Finance → Fallback: Alpha Vantage
Primary: CoinGecko → Fallback: Twelve Data  
Primary: FRED → Fallback: Quandl
Always validate data quality before storage
```

### 4. Smart Scheduling
```python
# Optimize collection timing:
- Market data: After market close
- Economic data: Weekly/monthly
- Crypto: 24/7 with rate limiting
- News/sentiment: Real-time during market hours
```
