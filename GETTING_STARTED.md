- **Advanced correlation models** (DCC-GARCH, VAR, rolling correlations)
- **Machine learning forecasting** (LSTM, ensemble methods)
- **Regime detection** (Hidden Markov Models, volatility clustering)
- **Interactive dashboards** (Streamlit with Plotly visualizations)
- **Multi-agent automation** (autonomous data collection and analysis)
- **Professional visualizations** (network graphs, heatmaps, time series)

### **Asset Coverage**
- **Equities**: Global indices, sector ETFs, individual stocks
- **Fixed Income**: Treasury yields, bond ETFs
- **Commodities**: Gold, oil, silver, agricultural futures
- **Currencies**: Major forex pairs
- **Crypto**: 50+ digital assets
- **Macro**: GDP, inflation, unemployment, central bank rates

### **Advanced Analytics**
- **Rolling correlations** with multiple time windows
- **Dynamic Conditional Correlation** (DCC-GARCH)
- **Vector Autoregression** (VAR) for multi-market interactions
- **LSTM neural networks** for correlation forecasting
- **Regime classification** (bull/bear/crisis detection)
- **Volatility clustering** analysis
- **Alternative data integration** (news sentiment)

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script
```bash
python quick_start.py
```

This automatically:
- Checks your Python version (needs 3.9+)
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Sets up project directories
- Creates configuration files

### Step 2: Get Your Free API Keys
1. **FRED API** (Federal Reserve Data):
- Visit: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
- Register for free, get API key

2. **Alpha Vantage** (Backup data):
- Visit: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
- Get free API key (5 calls/minute)

### Step 3: Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit the .env file with your API keys
nano .env

# Add your keys:
FRED_API_KEY=your_actual_fred_key_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_actual_alphavantage_key_here
```

### Step 4: Activate Environment
```bash
# macOS/Linux:
source correlation_env/bin/activate

# Windows:
correlation_env\Scripts\activate
```
