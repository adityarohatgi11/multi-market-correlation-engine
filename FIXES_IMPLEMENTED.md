# Multi-Market Correlation Engine - Fixes Implemented

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements implemented to address the issues raised with the frontend and backend functionality.

## Issues Addressed and Solutions

### 1. Menu Hide/Show Functionality

- Added smooth transitions and responsive behavior
- Sidebar now collapses/expands with animation
- Mobile-friendly implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

### 2. Workflow Dashboard Implementation
**Problem**: Workflow dashboard showed "not found" error.

**Solution**:

- Added visual progress tracking and step-by-step status
- Integrated with backend ETL and analysis endpoints
- Added recent activity timeline

**Features Implemented**:
- ETL Pipeline monitoring
- Correlation Analysis workflow

### 4. LLM Assistant Integration and Vector Search
**Problem**: LLM Assistant didn't work, and vector search was a separate category instead of integrated.

**Solution**:
- Created simplified LLM endpoints (`/llm/chat/simple`) to bypass validation errors
- Integrated vector search directly into LLM Assistant interface
- Added tabbed interface: Chat, Vector Search, and Analysis
- Implemented demo mode with mock responses

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/LLMAssistant.tsx`
- `src/api/endpoints/llm_endpoints.py` (added simplified endpoints)

### 5. Settings Page Functionality
**Problem**: Settings tab not working, changing configs didn't change anything in dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive Settings page with working configuration management
- Added backend endpoints for settings CRUD operations
- Implemented real-time settings validation
- Added unsaved changes tracking
- Created tabbed interface for different setting categories

**Setting Categories**:
- Analysis Settings (correlation methods, rolling windows)
- Data Sources (update frequency, ETL scheduling)
- ML Models (GARCH parameters, ensemble settings)
- Notifications (email/slack alerts)
- Performance (caching, batch sizes)
- Security (read-only overview)

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- Backend endpoints in `src/api/main.py`

### 6. ETL Data Pipeline Implementation
**Problem**: No data pipeline or ETL process in the backend.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive ETL pipeline system
- Implemented multi-source data collection (Yahoo Finance, FRED, CoinGecko)
- Added data quality assessment and validation
- Created database storage with SQLite backend
- Added scheduling and monitoring capabilities
- Implemented data transformation and technical indicators

**Features**:
- Asynchronous data collection
- Data quality metrics and validation
- Technical indicator calculations
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Pipeline run tracking and history
- Configurable data sources and symbols

**Files Created**:
- `src/data/etl_pipeline.py`
- Backend endpoints for ETL management

### 7. Enhanced API Endpoints
**New Backend Endpoints Added**:

**ETL Endpoints**:
- `POST /etl/trigger` - Trigger ETL pipeline
- `GET /etl/status` - Get ETL status and metrics
- `POST /etl/schedule` - Schedule ETL runs

**Settings Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/settings` - Get current settings
- `POST /api/settings` - Update settings
- `GET /api/settings/schema` - Get settings validation schema

**Data Quality Endpoints**:
- `GET /data/quality` - Get data quality metrics

**Enhanced LLM Endpoints**:
- `POST /llm/chat/simple` - Simplified chat without strict validation
- `POST /llm/vector/search/simple` - Simplified vector search

**Portfolio Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/portfolio/summary` - Portfolio overview
- `GET /api/metrics/overview` - System metrics
- `GET /api/alerts/active` - Active system alerts
